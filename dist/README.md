# GK Button

This is a button. It's a Vue component. It's simple as can be.

This button accepts some props:

```json
text: { default: "Click Me", type: String, },
uppercase: { default: true, type: Boolean, },
bgColor: { default: "#AAA09C", type: String, },
textColor: { default: "#fff", type: String, },
shadow: { default: true, type: Boolean, },
```

The button looks like this by default:

![button](button.png)

This package is really my idea of testing how to make and publish a reusable component. You don't need to waste your time.
